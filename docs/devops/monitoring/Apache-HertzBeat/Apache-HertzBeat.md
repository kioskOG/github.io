## ðŸŽ¡ Introduction
Apache HertzBeat is a user-friendly, open-source, real-time monitoring system. It is agentless, highly performant, Prometheus-compatible, and designed to provide powerful custom monitoring and status page capabilities.

---

## Features
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Supports monitoring for web services, programs, databases, caches, operating systems, web servers, middleware, big data platforms, cloud-native environments, networks, and custom metrics.
- **Ease of Use**: Web-based, agentless, and requires zero learning curve with one-click monitoring and alerting.
- **Prometheus-Compatible**: Seamlessly integrates with the Prometheus ecosystem, enabling easy monitoring of resources via a web UI.
- **High Performance**: Features multi-collector clusters, multi-isolated network monitoring, and cloud-edge collaboration for horizontal scalability.
- **Flexible Alerts**: Provides customizable alarm thresholds and timely notifications through Discord, Slack, Telegram, Email, WeChat, Webhook, and SMS.

## Technology Highlights

{: .important}
HertzBeat leverages established protocols and standards to collect monitoring data:
- **SNMP**: For network switches and routers.
- **JMX**: For Java application monitoring.
- **JDBC**: For database information.
- **SSH**: For script-based data collection.
- **HTTP/JSONPath/Prometheus**: For API-based metric collection.
- **IPMI**: For server hardware monitoring.

By abstracting these protocols into configurable YAML templates, HertzBeat allows users to create custom templates for any desired metric.
