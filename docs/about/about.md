## My Journey

I started my career as a system administrator and transitioned into DevOps to solve real-world operational challenges with automation. Over the years, I've worked on diverse projects ranging from building microservices architectures to automating infrastructure deployments for large-scale systems.

## Personal Philosophy

I believe in the power of **continuous learning** and embracing new technologies to stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape. My goal is to bridge the gap between development and operations by fostering a culture of collaboration and innovation.

## Hobbies

When I’m not coding or exploring new tools, you’ll find me:

- Learning about emerging cloud technologies.
- Reading tech blogs and sharing my insights.
- Experimenting with open-source projects.
